Have you ever spent countless hours planning the perfect approach, only to find yourself stuck in the same place weeks later? Overthinking doesn't just steal our time: it paralyses our potential, turning simple tasks into insurmountable mountains. Studies show that excessive planning often leads to decreased productivity and increased anxiety, making it one of the biggest barriers to personal and professional growth. As an over-thinker and over-planner myself, the most beneficial advice I have received has been to "sit down, and do the thing".

> We suffer more in imagination than in reality.

> ~ Seneca

We often torture ourselves with worry about potential outcomes more than the actual events themselves affect us. It's this fear of getting started that pushes us to procrastinate and put tasks off. I feel a sense of security in the instant gratification of accomplishing a simple goal, rather than the result of the delayed gratification of accomplishing the harder goal.

As a student this actively hampers the things I choose to do. The decisions I make shouldn't be void of any planning but I think that it's always good to make your own middle ground.

There are three components in the transition of inaction to action, the first is "the paralysis of overthinking", the second is "the liberation of taking action", and the third is "the growth through learning from failure". All of these are key in understanding the challenges that arise from inaction - the biggest issue being that you don't get the task at hand done.

# The paralysis of overthinking

To understand why imperfect action is so powerful, we must first examine what holds us back from taking action in the first place. "Analysis paralysis" or in this case, the paralysis of overthinking is simply the state of thinking so much about the task at hand that you don't make any forward progress on the task. This not only affects your decision-making abilities but also your ability to _take action_.

It could also be a sign of perfectionism, or just simply a fear of failure or future regret, or judgement or any negative emotion that could _possibly_ result from you doing the thing. The keyword here is _possibly_.

In perfectionism, you're actively aiming to make something that's _perfect_, this often leads to excessive planning before starting, if and only after starting you'll constantly revise and refine your work to get to as close to the ideal version that you're pursuing. The worst case scenario is that you'll keep finding flaws with that work and have difficulty declaring it be complete.

When you're afraid of failure or future regret, it's your brain telling you that things are not going to work out and that you shouldn't do the thing altogether. This is because of two things: the first is a lesser likelihood for you to take a risk in the first place and the second (but more notably) an increase in the _perceived_ risk, or the risk estimation.

Going back to what Seneca said, it's this perceived failure or the failure that we imagine, and the knock-on effects of the failure (which are often worse in our heads than they are in reality) that stops us from doing what we need to do.

# The liberation of taking action

While overthinking traps us in a cycle of inaction, breaking free requires a fundamental shift in how we approach our goals. The best quote I would say that encapsulates the pitfalls of overthinking and over-planning is something said by Petronius Arbiter, a Roman Satirist.

> We trained hard, but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form into teams, we would be reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing, and what a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization.

> ~ Petronius Arbiter

We get caught in the notion that planning is forward progress towards our goals but in reality, planning is just the starting point. The plan you made to tackle this complex task merely leads to inaction and the task remaining undone.”

In such cases, inaction breeds complacency, this keeps things in status quo. This entraps you in a place where if you feel comfortable enough with the present situation, it will lead to more inaction.

As a student, this could be planning out an essay to the extent where I have a bullet point for each sentence or paragraph that I need to write but I become comfortable with being partially "done".

This is where most people find it hard to do the thing they've been putting off. This is where the liberation of action comes through.

Let me share a personal example: When trying to get the website set up for this blog, I went through 6 or 7 iterations of trying to get "the perfect website" that could properly host all my posts and be _the_ place for all my writing going forward. I spent so much time that all of December went by without me deploying the website. At the end of the month, I chose to go with a template that was simple enough for me to get this blog out to the readers now.

There's always room for improvement, but that will take time and I'm more than happy with this being my first draft instead of the final product. Along the way, this website will go through its iterations and subsequent changes but more than anything I'm happy to have a product to show to people.

# The growth through learning from failure

Once we embrace action over perfection, we unlock perhaps the most valuable benefit of all - the opportunity to learn and grow from real-world experience. Once action is taken, the next challenge involves embracing the outcomes, including failure. John Dewey's "learn by doing" is core to this idea because it emphasizes the fact that "_effective learning takes place through meaningful experiences_". This means that even failures are important in learning. Hence, _imperfect action beats perfect planning_.

Failure is something that I'd say most over-thinkers or over-planners are afraid of, and I think this is completely natural. After all, even most world-class athletes won't deny that they're nervous when they're playing for the gold medal in the Olympics or an NBA finals game.

Taking action is just the beginning; the true growth happens when we reflect on our experiences. Without any of the forward motion where we take action towards our goals, we have nothing to reflect on, thereby stunting the possible growth.

This is why it's so important to just get to doing the task. Over-thinking about the problem that you'll face or the possible problems you'll tackle isn't tackling the problem.

# Practical advice

Just start. My way of getting started with tasks that are quite daunting is to first is to set a timer for 5 minutes, and just do whatever I can in those 5 minutes, usually after the timer rings, I start to feel that the task can be tackled and that the end is far closer than I initially thought.

This method is pretty good at mitigating the analysis paralysis that we face with a heavy task. It forces you to get whatever you can in those 5 minutes, and 5 minutes is not a lot of time to overthink or over-plan, this really forces you to making some kind of progress on the task which will make you feel liberated.

This leads into feeling good about making any progress at all instead of being stuck. It's just 5 minutes, if you think you can continue, just keep going, if you think that you need some time to plan, set another timer to plan things out or plan as you go, but with the initial 5 minute burst, it gets your brain going for the task.

Even if the progress isn't necessarily exactly what you see in the final outcome, you grow from the progress made instead of dwelling on the plan or 'what can be done,' learning and improving from _what you did_.

---

Ultimately, the journey from inaction to progress hinges on our ability to balance planning and action (preferably more action). So just get out there, and do the assignment you've been putting off, or finish the paper that you've been outlining for the past week. Just do the thing, even if it's imperfect, the forward momentum you've gained by doing it not perfectly puts you closer than just not starting at all.
